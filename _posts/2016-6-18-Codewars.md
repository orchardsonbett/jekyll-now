# Codewars

It's a platform that allows a person to train in different languages used in coding where the trainee can use a number of languages in order to be ranked in terms of *Kyu's*

A code trainee is ranked from:

 *8 kyu-1 kyu*
 
Languages used in solving the different challenges are java,javascript,ruby,python,c#,c++,closure and many more 

The difficulty level is from 8-1 being that the 8 kyu are easier and the 1 kyu are harder.

As a trainee I have had the pleasure of being part of this process where I tried to solve many of the problems in the codes given. I have faced a lot of problems when undertaking the codes.

More often I found myself having to go through a number of complex tutorials in order to get my head around the difficult codes.
