**Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)** in contrast to procedural Programming, is privileging data types over functions, that is, data determines what methods or functions we are supposed to use. Procedural Programming, on the other hand,requires that our methods or functions be used to manipulate data types. Most programming languages can be considered object-oriented, for example, Java. And this is how it works:

You first begin by creating a class, which acts as a blueprint. This blueprint contains variables and methods that are used with the object of our class. 

..1.Methods are the operations used for acting upon the data. They determine the behavior of our objects. 

..2.Variables are the attributes of our objects. 

..3.A class, therefore, defines the behavior and attributes of an object. 

When we instantiate a class by creating two objects, the first object's variables are different from the second object's variable. They basically don't share the same data members. However, the objects may share the same method since there is only one memory of the method in the class. We'll simply associate a particular instance with the method. In summary, each instance of a class has it's own copy of the variables but share the same method.
